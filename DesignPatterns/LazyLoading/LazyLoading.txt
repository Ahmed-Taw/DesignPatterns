Types:
1- Lazy Initialization
2- Virtual proxy   ---> need to handle identity or equality 
    - Make the property that will be accessed from proxy as virtual 
	- Create proxy type inheriting from the base type and override the virtual property
	-in the override of the property we initialize the property type or call the DB to load it 

3- Value Holder 
   - similar to Lazy load so if we work with .net 4 or higher use Lazy
