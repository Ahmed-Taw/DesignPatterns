Instead of calling different function to do a command based on the user input 

we can use the command pattern 
1- create command interface 
2- concrete implementation for each command 
3- Create I commandFactory interface which have function to create the command 

4- Create command executer which responsible call the command factory based on which command we received from the user 
5- to get the correct command to create that happened by register the available command in the command executer and with every new command we just register it
