Adding functionality to controls 
sealed classes 

Decorator is:
we have a base class and derived classes and we need to add functionality to those derived classes 
but we don't want to open it, or have a lot of combinations so we don't want to create a new class for each combinations

solution is decorator:
1- we create a class that inherit from the same base lass or interface which means we can pass it instead of those classes 
2- create a property inside that decorator with base class type to wrap the original class in it 
3- add your extra functionality to decorator
