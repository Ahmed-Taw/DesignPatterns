singlton is creating one and only one instance from a class in the application.
1- the class should contolr that it has only one instnce from it
2- it shouldn't has parameter for construction because 
	if it has parameter that means it could has different shaps or values 
	so it is not a singlton.

some times when creation of object is expensive singltone enhance the performance.
